\arguments{
\item{Reference_Batch}{Batch to use as reference for the integration.}

\item{Query_Batch}{Batch to correct.}

\item{Query_Batch_Cell_Types}{A number indicating the expected number of cells types on the batches to integrate. The default value is set as a string "Surprise-me" on which an estimation of the cell types is defined.}

\item{Similar_Cells}{A string value indicating in a semi-supervised the way MNNs pairs should be filtered. Accepted input values are "Low", "Medium" and "High".}

\item{Num_Clusters}{Number of clusters used to filter MNNs pairs.}

\item{Sampling}{Whether or not samples MNNs pairs' samples are used on the estimation process.}

\item{Number_Samples}{Number of MNNs pairs' samples used on the estimation process.}

\item{Pairs}{A matrix containing MNNs pairs. First column corresponds to query-batch cell indexes.}

\item{Cells_Index_Query}{Index of cells from the query-batch used as observations of the batch-effect.}

\item{Cells_Index_Reference}{Index of cells from the reference-batch used as observations of the batch-effect.}

\item{k_Neighbors}{Number of k-nearest-neighbors used to find MNNs pairs.}

\item{PCA}{Whether or not MNNs pairs are found under a principal components representation.}

\item{Dimensions}{PCA dimensions used to find MNNs pairs.}

\item{Max_Membership}{Maximum number of memberships used when memberships are automatically defined.}

\item{Fuzzy}{Whether or not a hiearchical integration scheme is used when correcting more than two batches.}
}
\value{
A list containing the corrected batch as a matrix and correction data
