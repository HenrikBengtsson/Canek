\arguments{
\item{refBatch}{Batch to use as reference for the integration.}

\item{queBatch}{Batch to correct.}

\item{cnRef}{TODO}

\item{cnQue}{TODO}

\item{queNumCelltypes}{A number indicating the expected number of cells types on the batches to integrate. The default value is set as a string "Surprise-me" on which an estimation of the cell types is defined.}

\item{maxMem}{Maximum number of memberships used when memberships are automatically defined.}

\item{pairs}{A matrix containing MNNs pairs. First column corresponds to query-batch cell indexes.}

\item{kNN}{Number of k-nearest-neighbors used to find MNNs pairs.}

\item{sampling}{Whether or not samples MNNs pairs' samples are used on the estimation process.}

\item{numSamples}{Number of MNNs pairs' samples used on the estimation process.}

\item{idxQuery}{Index of cells from the query-batch used as observations of the batch-effect.}

\item{idxRef}{Index of cells from the reference-batch used as observations of the batch-effect.}

\item{pcaDim}{PCA dimensions used to find MNNs pairs.}

\item{perCellMNN}{TODO}

\item{pairsFilter}{whether to perform pair filtering (default: FALSE)}

\item{verbose}{Print output}

A list containing the corrected batch as a matrix and correction data
}
\description{
Function to correct batch effect over two batches
}
\details{
Canek, a new non-linear/linear hybrid method for batch-effect correction that couples identification of similar cells
 between datasets using Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNNs) with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

 A non-linear correction is performed by using fuzzy logic to join a set of linear correction vectors which are cell-type locally estimated.

x <- SimBatches$batches[[1]]
