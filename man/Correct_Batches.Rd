\description{
Batch-Effect correction over a list of single cell batches
}
\details{
Correct_Batches is non-linear/linear hybrid method for single-cell batch-effect correction that couples identification of similar cells
 between datasets using Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNNs) with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

 A non-linear correction is performed using fuzzy logic to join a set of linear correction vectors which are cell-type locally estimated.
