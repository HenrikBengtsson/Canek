\arguments{
\item{Batches}{List of batches to integrate. Batches should contain the same number of genes as rows.}

\item{Query_Batch_Cell_Types}{A number indicating the expected number of cells types on the batches to integrate. The default value is set as a string "Surprise-me" on which an estimation of the cell types is defined.}

\item{Similar_Cells}{A string value indicating in a semi-supervised the way MNNs pairs should be filtered. Accepted input values are "Low", "Medium" and "High".}

\item{Num_Clusters}{Number of clusters used to filter MNNs pairs.}

\item{Sampling}{Whether or not sampling of MNNs pairs is used on the estimation process.}

\item{Number_Samples}{Number of MNNs pairs samples used on the estimation process.}

\item{k_Neighbors}{Number of k-nearest-neighbors used to find MNNs pairs.}

\item{PCA}{Whether or not MNNs pairs are found under a principal components representation.}

\item{Dimensions}{PCA dimensions used to find MNNs pairs.}

\item{Max_Membership}{Maximum number of memberships used when memberships are automatically defined.}

\item{Fuzzy}{Whether or not a fuzzy logic join is used on the local correction vectors.}

\item{Hierarchical}{Whether or not a hiearchical integration scheme is used when correcting more than two batches.}
}
\value{
A list containing the integrated datasets as matrix and the correction data .
