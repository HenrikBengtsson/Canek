\usage{
Fuzzy(cluMem = NULL, pcaQue = NULL, corCell = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluMem}{Memberships' clustering data.}

\item{pcaQue}{PCA representation of the cells.}

\item{corCell}{Matrix containing the initial membership assignment.
Matrix dimensions are expected as #Cell x #Memberships, with each row sum equal to 1.}

\item{verbose}{Print output.}
}
\description{
Function to score cell's memberships by fuzzy logic
}
\details{
This function stablishes the fuzzification for the cells' membership.
 A minimum spanning tree (MST) is created among memberships, and the fuzzification is performed
  for each of the edges of the MST.#'
